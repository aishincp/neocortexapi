# NeoCortexApi - To Implement Trace SDR Method

The goal of our project is to implement the well-formatted tracing of multiple SDRs that we will get using StringifyVector() method, so they can be easily compared in the output window.

## Project Description 
In this project we have to trace out the SDr values using the below mentioned method
Helpers.StringifyVector(lyrOut.PredictiveCells.Select(c => c.Index).ToArray())

Using StringifyVector() method, we get the SDR
